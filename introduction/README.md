#Trust and Unknown In The Networked Society - Paranoia is Fair Reaction
=======================================================================

Society is moving online.  We have an increasing dependance on digital information shared by us, kept by our companies, information that is used for advantage and game.  

Online is also changing.  The Internet is moving from serving documents to managing the real time status of the world right now.  

Living in a safe society is as important when living online as it is when living offline.  A society that is not safe can never function to its optimum level for all.  The definition of safety in a civilized society is one where it is behaving as it is suppose to.  And since society is nothing more than a sum of its underlying systems, each system has to behave as it expected to.  *We have to trust this is true of the systems we depend upon and we serve.*  The challenge is what happens when this cannot be trusted to be true.  

We know this is inherently true at all levels.

Safe Society = Sum of Safe Systems

Safe System = one that behaves the way it should

Note we can have mal intent systems as all societies do.  It is a civilized society's job to weed out and remove such systems that impede the "general good".  However even these mal intent systems should function as they should.  

We know online society is under attack.  Everyday a new breach of security and trust is reported.

This trend is growing and it should not surprise us.  There is big money to be made from online crime.  And the online community today is as safe as the people who lived in the Wild West 100 years ago.  We choose to all live there, privately and professionally, because of the enormous potential upside outweigh our fear of attack.  

Yet the risk of attack is very real and as said is increasing.

If you are running or responsible for any kind of online business you are currently under attack. 
If you are a customer of any "online" service, such as using a credit card at Target, then you are exposed.

There are two continuous fears when responsible for any online activity

* Fear of Unknown - "I don't know what is going on.  I may have been hacked and not know (Target)"
* Fear of Trust - I have to trust certain people/businesses - both internal and external (Snowdon)

First have you already been compromised and you don't know the distance between compromise and realization.  Time difference equalled 30 million credit cards for Target.

The second is who can you trust.  Over 30% of cyber exploits are performed by internal employees. [refcccc]

Traditional online security has resonated around 3 basic paradigms:

* Confidentiality
* Integrity
* Accessability

These are excellently covered here:

* Joyent Links

The least mature of these has always been integrity.  As any security expert will lecture, the first working assumption on securing any system is *to assume the credentials have been compromised*.

* Is the file the same?
* is the system the same?

Is the file the same as yesterday?

Is the file the same as 5 years ago?

If the document is an affadavit for a murder trial 5 years ago then this is an important statement to make.  For Target the question they needed to ask was "*is this software the same software that my POS company gave me?*"


The nirvana of the Internet since the 90's has always been the creation of an "attributable Internet", one where data history exists and cannot be altered. This has been attempted before using PKI technology but this has never scaled and there has still beeen a need to trust the people who administer the keys.  

For the growing online cloud based world there is more and more need for trust.  Both as a provider and as a customer.  But trust is the most expensive currency to spend in any business transaction.  Trust is better when combined with transparency and very good when none ambigous proof is in place.  

This is the promise of mutual auditability:

##How to Create a Safe System

Systems already exist today.  They have implemented security.  yet breaches occur at an ever accelerating rate.  Two critical questions need to be answered by all people operating such systems:

* "How do I know that my system hasn't already been compromised?"
* "What are the critical actions that could lead to breach?"

eg. For Target this was the upgrade of all point of sale terminals with compromised software.

Instrumenting a system for mutual auditability is a paradigm shift in securing systems.  Rather than trying to create barriers it catalogues critical system changes building an auditable provable chain of record.

For example when Target upgraded it's point of sale terminals it should have been able to ask "Is this the exact software that was delivered to me from the offical development?"  The validation of such a question should be non-repudiable.

Then if breech still occured, while not ideal, Target insurance could be indemnified and liability moved to the software provider.  

Savings in the legal costs alone cover any implementation costs many times over.

Software upgrade is one example of a critical action in a system.  All such critical actions need to be mutually auditable.  

The technology behind mutual auditability is Key Signature Infrastructure (KSI).
